# PostgreSQL Decommission Tool Enhancements - Patch Summary

This document summarizes the enhancements and bug fixes applied to the `PostgreSQLDecommissionTool` to improve its scanning, reference removal, and Git workflow integration capabilities.

## Key Improvements:

1.  **Refactored `scan_repository` for Accurate Detection:**
    *   The `scan_repository` method was refactored to independently check for PostgreSQL references based on file types (Helm charts, PVCs, ConfigMaps, source code).
    *   This resolved the issue where PVC files were not correctly detected due to an overly broad initial content filter.
    *   The method now accurately populates findings with structured dictionaries, providing richer metadata.

2.  **Enhanced `remove_references` for Robust YAML Handling:**
    *   The `remove_from_dict` helper function within `remove_references` was significantly improved.
    *   It now handles string replacements for `db_name` and `postgresql` occurrences directly within YAML values.
    *   The logic for deleting entire dictionary entries or list items related to PostgreSQL was refined to ensure comprehensive and clean removal without leaving orphaned or invalid YAML structures.

3.  **Comprehensive Git Workflow Integration:**
    *   Ensured robust Git branch management, including creating, switching, and deleting test branches, to facilitate safe and isolated modifications.
    *   The tool now correctly stages and commits changes, providing a clear audit trail.

4.  **Updated Summary and Plan Generation:**
    *   The `generate_summary_and_plan` function was updated to produce more detailed and accurate decommissioning plans, reflecting the refined findings structure.

5.  **Test Suite Alignment and Validation:**
    *   The test suite (`tests/test_decommission_tool.py` and `tests/test_remove_functionality.py`) was updated to align with the refactored code and new findings structure.
    *   All identified test failures, including those related to incomplete YAML removal and plan string mismatches, have been resolved.

6.  **Enhanced Testing and Workflow:**
    *   **`--dont-delete` Flag:** Added a `--dont-delete` command-line option to `pytest` to preserve test branches after e2e runs for manual inspection and debugging.
    *   **E2E Branch Lifecycle Test:** Implemented a new end-to-end test (`test_e2e_branch_lifecycle`) that validates the entire Git workflow: branch creation, code modification, committing, and conditional cleanup.
    *   **`Makefile` Improvements:**
        *   Added `test-e2e-inspect` target to run the e2e test and keep the branch.
        *   Added `test-e2e-branch` target for running the e2e test with automatic cleanup.
        *   Consolidated and improved the `clean` target to remove all generated files and caches.
        *   Fixed the `ci` target to correctly run the e2e tests.

## Current Status:

All unit, integration, and e2e tests are passing. The `PostgreSQLDecommissionTool` is now robust, performs its intended functions accurately, and provides an improved testing and development workflow. The project is ready for final review.
